Hello!

This is a simple demonstration of implementation of microservices architecture in Visual Studio using C#. The project consists of three separate programs:
  1. A program that generates preudo-random number (PRNG);
  2. A program that, given non-negative integer _i_ generates the path to the image on the local drive (IMGSRV);
  3. A user interfase in Widnows Forms (Microservices_UI) that has a button which on click event performs:
      a. Calls the PRNG Service
      b. Calls the Image service using the pseudo-random number from the PRNG Service
      c. Displays the image and path to it according to the information generated by other two services

Each of these programs runs in a different process, and programs do not call each other directly. As the communication pipe, it uses text files as follows:
  a. UI calls PRNG by writing the command run to _prng-service.txt_
  b. PRNG reads _prng_service.txt_, erases it, and writes a pseudo-random number to it (to minimize generation of   repeated number the logic was added to compare two previously generted numbers to the newly generated number)
  c. UI reads _image_service.txt_ then displays the image and path to the user.
